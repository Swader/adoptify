# Adoptify

Adoptify is a *pet project* (wink wink, get it?) of mine where people can put pets up for adoption with certain conditions and descriptions, and others can adopt them.

It's still heavily a work in progress, as it's being used as the base for many SitePoint tutorials, but it's getting there.

It'll be powered by Diffbot for some image recognition as per [this post](http://www.sitepoint.com/building-microsofts-what-dog-ai-in-under-100-lines-of-code).

The project is based on [nofw](https://github.com/swader/nofw).

More info soon.
